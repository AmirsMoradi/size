This is a program that allows you to enlarge and reduce the photo using your hand. No photo will be displayed unless your hand is in the frame. Place your photo on the path and when your hand is in the frame, your photo will be displayed. When you bring your two hands into the frame, you can enlarge and reduce your photo by moving your hands closer together and away from each other.......
I will soon be adding new updates to the program. If you have any comments about this program, I would be happy to hear them....
